-------
A python based password generator project with GUI.
The python program/script will generate a password of 8 to 100 characters with at least one capital letter, lowercase letter, symbol, and number. 
Passwords are generated by python's secrets module and shuffled using user's operating system.

Should you actually use this program to generate your passwords?:
Probably not, this is more of a personal project for learning.
